ðŸ”¹ REST API (Representational State Transfer â€“ Application Programming Interface)

Definition:

REST is an architectural style for designing web services.

REST APIs allow communication between client and server using HTTP methods.

Key Principles:

Stateless â†’ Each request is independent; server does not store client session.

Client-Server â†’ Separation of frontend (client) and backend (server).

Uniform Interface â†’ Same rules (URLs, methods, status codes) across the API.

Cacheable â†’ Responses can be cached to improve performance.

Layered System â†’ Multiple layers (proxy, load balancer) without affecting client.

HTTP Methods:

GET â†’ Retrieve data.

POST â†’ Create new resource.

PUT â†’ Update entire resource.

PATCH â†’ Update part of a resource.

DELETE â†’ Remove resource.

Data Format:

Mostly uses JSON (also XML, plain text, etc.).

Endpoints:

API resources are accessed via URLs (e.g., /users, /products/123).

Status Codes:

200 OK â†’ Success.

201 Created â†’ Resource created.

400 Bad Request â†’ Invalid request.

401 Unauthorized â†’ Authentication needed.

404 Not Found â†’ Resource not available.

500 Internal Server Error â†’ Server issue.

âœ… In short:

A REST API is a simple, stateless, and scalable way to let applications communicate over HTTP using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with JSON data.x
